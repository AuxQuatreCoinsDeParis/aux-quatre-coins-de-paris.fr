# Paris in love
Let’s assume for example you are a couple in love and it would be the first time you visit Paris.

For a first visit of Paris, you cannot miss the « top 5 » that is the **Louvre,** the **Eiffel tower, Notre-Dame cathedral, Montmartre neighbourhood** and the **Champs Élysées.**

What are the assets of Aux quatre coins de Paris?

## Montmartre

We suggest you for example to take a delicious breakfast in a small café that cultivates the art of good living (and eating well) from good old days before you start your visit of the Montmartre hill. For this visit, you will find with your travel plan an itinerary in the neighbourhood and the corresponding maps and instructions to discover this area without missing any point of interest of this so particular place! Besides, we indicate you where to buy quality souvenirs to bring back home!

## Louvre

First of all, with Aux quatre coins de Paris, your tickets are bought in advance. You only have to arrive at the dedicated entrance at the indicated time. Skip the lines!
For this visit, you will find with your travel plan an itinerary of approximately 2 hours in the museum with some comments on the major works of art. Do not miss the essential without staying hours in the museum!
The weather is nice? Let’s plan a picnic in the Tuileries gardens!
