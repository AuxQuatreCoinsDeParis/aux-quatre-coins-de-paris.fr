## Paris with friends

Let’s assume for example you are a group of four girlfriends coming to have good times in Paris.

You already know the major parisian museums and monuments and do not wish to focus on cultural activities during your stay.

Here is what Aux quatre coins de Paris can do for you!

## Gastronomy

You want your day to start slowly? Aux quatre coins de Paris can advise you on the best brunches in Paris!

You wish a gourmet break? Paris is full of tea rooms where to eat delicious pastries like a typical parisian woman!

Besides, as a cosmopolitan city, Paris gathers many restaurants offering world’s cuisines!

## Shopping

If there is one activity you cannot miss when coming to Paris with girlfriends, it definitely is shopping!

Go window shopping at the Grands Magasins on the Haussmann boulevard or at the glass-roofed passageways, or enjoy a shopping tour with Aux quatre coins de Paris! Together we’ll discover what makes the so special style of the parisian women!

## Paris at night

Paris is a moveable feast! Aux quatre coins de Paris can plan for you a night enjoying fine wines in an excellent wine bar or drinking nice cocktails on a rooftop with an astonishing view over Paris.

Do you fancy live music? Come and enjoy a genuinely parisian-bohemian-style night listening to gypsy jazz while tasting good typical French food and get into the atmosphere of a Woody Allen’s movie for one night!
