# Paris with children

Let’s assume for example you are a family with 8-year-old and 10-year-old children, and you wish your stay is playful and educational at the same time.

If it is your first visit of Paris, you cannot miss the « top 5 », that is the **Louvre museum,** the **Eiffel tower, Notre-Dame cathedral, Montmartre neighbourhood** and the **Champs Élysées,** but you need to get off the beaten tracks a bit.

How *Aux quatre coins de Paris* can help you?

## Culture

Discover great museums such as the Louvre or the Orsay museum with a treasure hunt! Very funny, your children will remember what they saw!

Go admire the view on top of the towers of Notre-Dame, the Arc de Triomphe or on top of the Pantheon, children love this! Seize the opportunity at the Pantheon to show them Foucault’s pendulum, proof the Earth is turning!
