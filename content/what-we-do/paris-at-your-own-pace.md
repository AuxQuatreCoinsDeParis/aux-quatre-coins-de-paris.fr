# Paris at your own pace

Let’s assume for example you are a couple of seniors and you wish to visit Paris again.

You know the main parisian monuments and museums, so you would rather get off the beaten tracks. Besides, you do not walk a lot. You agree to make an effort (after all this is Paris!) but you do not wish to spend the entire day standing up and walking.

Aux quatre coins de Paris is there for you.

## Visits

Aux quatre coins de Paris suggests you to visit more confidential museums and monuments such as the Rodin museum, the Marmottan-Monet museum (if you have not visited the Orsay museum yet), the hôtel des Invalides (Napoleon’s tomb) or the Garnier opera house for example. There will always be something to visit in Paris!

## Gastronomy

What better way to rest during your day than sitting at a good table? If you wish, Aux quatre coins de Paris plans for you seated lunch breaks, not too long and of quality during your days of visits.

You can also seize the opportunity to taste wines and/or cheeses!

## Paris at night

Liven up your evenings with Aux quatre coins de Paris! We can book for you a ride in typically French old cars (2CV or DS cars), a dinner cruse or a night at the Lido or the Moulin Rouge for example. Of course, all our plannings are adapted according to the pace you want.

## Transports

Aux quatre coins de Paris can plan for you your airport-hotel-airport transfers with a private driver, and all your transfers outside Paris such as an excursion to Versailles if you wish.

If you wish to use parisian public transports, we optimise your journeys by helping you to choose a hotel with a good location and we buy in advance public transports tickets for you.


**And even if it would be your first visit in Paris, we have a travel plan for you!**


* *The activities booked besides are charged in addition to our services. Aux quatre coins de Paris plans and books activities for you without taking any commission.*
