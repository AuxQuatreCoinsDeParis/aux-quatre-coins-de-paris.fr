Audrey, founder of Aux quatre coins de Paris, welcomes you the day of your arrival. She will meet you on your place of accomodation and will help you to quickly take your mark in the city. At that time, she will also give you your welcome kit including a printed version of your travel plan, a special guide to make the most of Paris, a public transport map, a prepaid French SIM card and all the tickets and vouchers for the activities you booked with us.

The French SIM card will make communications easier in Paris: you will be able to join us on the phone. We will answer all of your questions!
