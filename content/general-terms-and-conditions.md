## II / Services

The Provider offers several Services.

The Service called « planning » includes the fulfilment of a bespoke travel plan according to the Client’s wishes for the duration of his stay in Paris. The indicated price is for the organisation of a stay up to eight days in Paris or Paris region, every additional day leads to an extra cost of 30€ per day (all taxes included).
The organisation of this stay includes :

1. recommendations to choose the Client’s accomodation and activities in Paris, advice to move around the city (means of transport at the best rate), to choose restaurants, bars and any other places to go out along with places to shop for oneself or to buy souvenirs if needed.
2. restaurants, bars, private drivers reservations and the purchases in advance of tickets for the suggested activities when possible. The purchases in advance of tickets are charged in addition to Aux quatre coins de Paris’ Services. They appear on the global invoice sent to the Client and must be paid to confirm all reservations. All prices are given to the Client prior to the drawing up of the invoice so that only the purchases agreed by the Client will appear on the invoice. The Provider can also purchase in advance public transport tickets for Paris and Paris region.
3. a personal meeting with the Client at his arrival on his place of accomodation. During this meeting, a printed version of his bespoke travel plan will be given to the Client with a guidebook gathering all the necessary information to have a nice stay in Paris. Besides, the tickets for the various activities and/or transport purchased in advance for the Client will also be given during this meeting (if ordered), along with a French SIM card. Moreover, the Client will get insider’s tips to live Paris like a local. The meeting ends with a walk in the neighbourhood to locate the closest metro station and bus stops as well as the closest mini-market (grocery store), ATM, bakery, pharmacy, and post office.
4. a phone assistance seven days a week during the Client’s stay in Paris. The Provider is reachable by phone or text messages, every day from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. If the Provider doesn’t answer, the Client is invited to let a vocal message or to send a text message. The Provider will answer as soon as possible (within a maximum of two hours except in cases of force majeure or fortuitous event).

The Service called « private tours » includes either the creation of a bespoke itinerary in Paris according to the Client’s wishes (bespoke walking tour « Paris as you like it »), or the adaptation of an itinerary predefined by the Provider (« In France, eat as the French do », « Fashion shopping in Paris », « Aux quatre coins du Marais » private walking tours). A tour lasts half a day (four hours), or more if the Client asks for extra hours (every extra-hour costs 30€ all taxes included). Besides, as the tours are all walking tours, they may include the use of public transport. Transport costs, food or drinks are not included in our private tours.

## III / Purchasing process

To place an order, the Client must first contact the Provider through the contact form.

To create the Client’s bespoke travel plan, the Provider needs some information about the Client. The Client must give the needed information to the Provider, either by answering the form that will be sent to him by Aux quatre coins de Paris, or during an online meeting with the Provider (video conference via Skype).

For this purpose, the Client accepts to give personal, complete and correct information to identify him correctly in every situation, and to carry out the Service(s). The Client also accepts to keep his information up to date in case of changes. Any fanciful and/or contrary to public order and/or infringing any third party’s rights information is likely to cancel the Client’s order.

The Provider then comes back to the Client with a suggestion for his bespoke travel plan (activities and transports in Paris, restaurants and hotels) and the related fares to the activities and transports. Once the Client made his choice and agreed the related fares, the Provider sends him an invoice with the price of his Service(s), the potential extras and the prices of the various activities the Client wishes to purchase (except for accomodation). The payment is carried out on line (through Paypal). The payment for the plane tickets and the accomodation remains on the Client’s initiative. Besides, as soon as the Client knows his arrival and departure dates as well as his accomodation address, he agrees to give them to the Provider.

The Order will be considered as definitive only when the whole payment is received that is, Aux quatre coins de Paris' Service(s) and all the activities in Paris will be confirmed only when the whole payment is received. The activities are charged as disbursements.

The Provider is only acting as an intermediary between the Client and third party providers. The Provider will only answer to requests that are legal in France.

All reservations are subject to availability at the time of booking. Any oral indication about price is only an estimate of the final price that cannot be considered as definitive. The final price will be known only when the reservation is confirmed. All reservations with Aux quatre coins de Paris are subject to these general terms and conditions and to the third party providers’ limits of liability.

## IV / Prices and payment terms

**4.1. Prices**

If the alternative service happens to be shorter in time or lower in quality than the one initially booked, the Client will be repaid the price difference.

If one of the third party providers does not fulfil his service, for whatever reason, the Client will be repaid the price of the service. Aux quatre coins de Paris then reserves the right to turn against the defaulting provider to ask for reimbursement.

**6.2. Concerning Aux quatre coins de Paris’ Services**

Besides, the liability of the Provider cannot be engaged if the non-fulfiment or the defective fulfilment of his own Services is attributable to the Client, to the unpredictable and unsurmontable act of a third-party, or to a case of force majeure as defined by French law.

## VII / Cancellation

**7.1. Concerning third party providers’ services**

Any cancellation of a third party provider’s service by the Client must be written and sent to Aux quatre coins de Paris to the address : [audrey@quatre-coins.paris](mailto:audrey@quatre-coins.paris). The cancellation will be effective only when the Provider learns of it.

Aux quatre coins de Paris acts as an authorised representative for the Client. The price of such a cancelled service will be repaid only if the third party provider offers a reimbursement. This reimbursement may be partial according to the moment the cancellation occurs. In any case, Aux quatre coins de Paris commits to passing on the whole amount repaid to the Client.

In case of reimbursement, it will be done either in cash directly to the Client during his stay in Paris, or by wire transfer if he cannot come to Paris. This wire transfer may lead to bank charges that shall exclusively be borne by the Client. The amount of these charges will then be cut off from the amount of the reimbursement.

The activities ordered by the Client are booked at fixed times. A late arrival of more than 20 minutes is considered as a no-show and Aux quatre coins de Paris, as any other involved third party provider, will not have to provide the service, nor to repay it.
