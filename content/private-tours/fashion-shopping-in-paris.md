We plan together an itinerary according to your wishes (outfits, shoes, bags, accessories, lingerie) and your budget for this shopping session.

This tour is not about browsing the major French luxury brands, they already glow by themselves, but rather about discovering emerging brands that are durably taking root in the French everyday fashion.

This tour preferably takes place during the week (from Monday to Friday) to get a better shopping experience. For the same reason, we do not recommend more than three participants for this tour. That being said, accompanists are welcome!

* Duration of the tour:  approximately 4h
* Topic: women's fashion
* 3 participants maximum
* Price: 180€

This price doesn’t include transport costs, food or drinks, nor the purchases made by the participants the same day.

*It is possible to schedule a longer tour for a price of 30 € all taxes included per extra hour beyond the 4th hour.*

A similar tour for men will be soon available! If you have any question, please contact us.
