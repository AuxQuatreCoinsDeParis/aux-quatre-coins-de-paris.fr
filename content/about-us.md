# Who we are

Aux quatre coins de Paris is a young company full of enthusiasm for Paris. We love where we live and we want to share it. We wish you to fall in love with Paris too, whether it rains or shines. There is always a way to make the most of this city and we are here for this. We, or at least I, Audrey.
